### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a junior at Iowa State studying Aerospace Engineering. I am super interested in learning about space. I am slowlly becoming more and more intersted in planes. I am most interested in military aircraft and making commercial air travel faster. 



In my free time I play ultimate frisbee! I've been playing frisbee for 9 years and play on a club team at Iowa State. I also enjoy playing the piano and ukulele. I've recently started playing lots of Guitar Hero on the wii. I hope to be able to play on expert by the end of the semester.
